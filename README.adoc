Pet project to show how to publish metrics (e.g. code coverage, mutation testing) to https://www.sonarqube.org/[sonar], with different language and tools (e.g. https://www.java.com[java] with https://gradle.org/[gradle] / https://maven.apache.org/[maven], https://nodejs.org[node], https://www.typescriptlang.org/[typescript])

#### How to run
* Start docker containers: `make deps`
* Log on http://localhost:9000/admin/marketplace[sonar], install plugins

Then collect metrics and send to sonar:

* for node projects: `npm install` / `npm run jenkins`
* for gradle projects: `gradle jenkins`
* for maven project: `make jenkins`

#### Todo
* Mutation Testing with Gradle + Groovy + Spock
* sample with integration test (with coverage) 
* Quality gateways (e.g. break build if coverage < X%)
